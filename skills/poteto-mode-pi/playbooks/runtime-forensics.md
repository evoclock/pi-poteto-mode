Source: pstack 0.15.36, Lauren Tan (MIT); [UPSTREAM.lock.json](../../../UPSTREAM.lock.json). Read [Pi boundaries](../../how/WORKFLOW_BOUNDARIES.md) and [source-name mapping](../../how/UPSTREAM_MAPPING.md) first. Copy the source steps verbatim into the task list, retaining skipped steps and their reasons. Add the boundary under each step; never silently replace the source checklist.

### Runtime forensics

**You own the diagnosis. Instrument the live process, don't theorize from source.** The deliverable is a cited diagnosis, not a fix.

> **Pi boundary.** Pi: use read, edit and bash only within this step's scope, and TaskList/TaskCreate/TaskUpdate for the checklist. For delegated steps, use a Treehouse lease and agentic_herdr_spawn_worker for a Pi agent in a Herdr pane; brief/report via agentic_herdr_communication. Follow UPSTREAM_MAPPING.md for exact calls. If a required tool or role is absent, retain this step as blocked/skip; never substitute a cloud agent.

1. Capture the live signal on the matching surface via the control skill: a CPU profile for a spinning process, a heap snapshot for a leak, a CDP trace for a visual glitch. A real artifact, not a guess.

2. Reduce the artifact to the smoking gun: the function on the hot path, the retainer chain from the leaked object to a GC root, the loop firing without input. Parse large artifacts in a subagent (the **guard-the-context-window** principle skill), keep the reduced finding in the main thread. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section.

3. Prove the mechanism before believing it. Inject instrumentation via CDP eval on the running process, or hotfix the live code without reloading, to confirm the hypothesis cheaply.

4. Map the finding back to source: file, symbol, the line that allocates or schedules.

5. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only forensics`.

**Reply:** the signal captured, the reduced finding, how you proved the mechanism, the source location, artifact paths. No fix unless asked. Hand back to Bug fix or Perf once the cause is known.
