## Pi adaptation contract

Read [shared boundaries](../how/WORKFLOW_BOUNDARIES.md) and [the source-name mapping](../how/UPSTREAM_MAPPING.md) before the procedure. Source: pstack 0.15.36; file and body hashes in [UPSTREAM.lock.json](../../UPSTREAM.lock.json). The source wording below is retained verbatim; the additive Pi boundaries constrain its effects. This is an instruction port with declared policy and capability differences, not a claim of runtime equivalence.

Pi: use read, edit and bash only within this step's scope, and TaskList/TaskCreate/TaskUpdate for the checklist. For delegated steps, use a Treehouse lease and agentic_herdr_spawn_worker for a Pi agent in a Herdr pane; brief/report via agentic_herdr_communication. Follow UPSTREAM_MAPPING.md for exact calls. If a required tool or role is absent, retain this step as blocked/skip; never substitute a cloud agent.

# Model the Domain

Encode the real domain in a data structure instead of scattering it across conditionals. A structure that matches the domain makes invalid states unrepresentable and deletes branches. Choosing it at write time is cheap. Recovering it later reads as a refactor and gets deferred.

- Any other structure that fits. When none fits, work out what the code must never allow and how the data gets read, then find the structure that encodes exactly that.

Do not force an abstraction. Prefer boring code if the current shape is already clear, local, and unlikely to grow. Be skeptical of an abstraction that adds indirection without removing branches, duplicated rules, invalid states, or lifecycle risk.

The sign that you skipped this is a new feature that grows an existing if/else chain by one more branch, or a second boolean that must stay in sync with the first. Temporal decomposition is another sign. Phase-named modules repeat the same domain rules across steps.
