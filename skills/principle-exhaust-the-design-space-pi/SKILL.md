## Pi adaptation contract

Read [shared boundaries](../how/WORKFLOW_BOUNDARIES.md) and [the source-name mapping](../how/UPSTREAM_MAPPING.md) before the procedure. Source: pstack 0.15.36; file and body hashes in [UPSTREAM.lock.json](../../UPSTREAM.lock.json). The source wording below is retained verbatim; the additive Pi boundaries constrain its effects. This is an instruction port with declared policy and capability differences, not a claim of runtime equivalence.

Pi: use read, edit and bash only within this step's scope, and TaskList/TaskCreate/TaskUpdate for the checklist. For delegated steps, use a Treehouse lease and agentic_herdr_spawn_worker for a Pi agent in a Herdr pane; brief/report via agentic_herdr_communication. Follow UPSTREAM_MAPPING.md for exact calls. If a required tool or role is absent, retain this step as blocked/skip; never substitute a cloud agent.

It also applies to product design decisions where user experience depends on feel, not logic.
